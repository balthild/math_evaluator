# math_evaluator

An interpreter for math expressions.

**Note**: This library is still in an early state, the test coverage is not perfect, the performance is not optimized and some features are still unimplemented.

# Usage

```dart
var result = evaluate("1+sin(Ï€/2)");
print(result); // prints "2"
```
